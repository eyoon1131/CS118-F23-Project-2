• Implemented reliable data transfer and congestion control protocol as specified in lecture/textbook
• In our implementation sstresh is initialized to 15 and is halved upon packet loss
• uses cumulative ACKs as seen in TCP taught in class
• for congestion control, our protocol follows TCP, starting in slow start phase, entering congestion avoidance when window size reaches ssthresh and enters fast recovery if fast retransfer is triggered
• uses fast retransmit where upon 3 duplicate ACKs being received packet is retransferred
• server side buffers out of order packets
